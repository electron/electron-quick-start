			      CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 0.7

BUG FIXES

  o if both the 'file' and 'text' arguments are provided but file = NULL,
  e.g. markdownToHTML(file = NULL, text = ?), markdownToHTML() can throw an
  error indicating the file is invalid (thanks, Tyler Rinker,
  hadley/staticdocs#66)

  o markdownToHTML(text = ?, output = ?) was broken (#54)

			      CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 0.6.5

  always encoded in UTF-8 now (thanks, Kohske Takahashi, #50)

			      CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 0.6.4

  Contributed by Henrik Bengtsson.

  (see browseVignettes('markdown'))

  o the default CSS style was tweaked (major changes include: page width is
  at most 800px, more line height, slightly larger fonts, and a different
  syntax highlighting theme)

			      CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 0.6.3

NEW FEATURES

  o added a new argument 'template' to markdownToHTML() so that we can
  customize the HTML template (by default, it uses the template
  'resources/markdown.html' in this package); thanks, Nacho Caballero

  o the options markdown.HTML.stylesheet and markdown.HTML.header used in
  markdownToHTML() can be character vectors (they will be processed by
  paste(x, collapse = '\n')

MAJOR CHANGES

  o the 'text' argument in markdownToHTML() and renderMarkdown() is treated
  as lines of input now, i.e. if 'text' is provided, it is passed to the
  markdown renderer as paste(text, collapse = '\n'); in the previous
  versions, it was processed by paste(text, collapse = '')

  o fixed #26: the HTML output file will be written relative to the
  current working directory now when it contains images that need to
  be base64 encoded

  o fixed #28: the image URL should be decoded before the image is
  based64 encoded
