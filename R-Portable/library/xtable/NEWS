1.8-2 (NOT YET SUBMITTED TO CRAN)
  * Added function print.xtableMatharray to enable easy creation of
    LaTeX code to enable an array to be included in a document.
  * Added example to the gallery using sanitizing headings and row
    names to produce large bold headings and italic row names.
  * Added code from Martin Gubri, martin.gubri@framasoft.org, to produce
    tables from the spatial econometrics packages, spdep, splm, and
    sphet.
  * Extracted sanitize functions from print.xtable as stand-alone
    functions, and exported them. Added helper functions as.is and
    as.math for assistance with sanitization (supplied by Stefan
    Edwards <sme@iysik.com> in Feature Request #5303).
  * Added option to produce math style exponents when sanitizing
    numbers, as suggested by Don Armstrong <don@donarmstrong.com>, who
    also provided code
  * Fixed bug #6907. Warning was created when the data frame as no
    rows for type is 'html'. Added a test to create the matrix
    requested specially in that case. Original code was
    BTD2 <- matrix(align.tmp[(2-pos):(ncol(x)+1)],
                   nrow = nrow(x), ncol = ncol(x)+pos, byrow = TRUE)
    which created a matrix with no rows, but gave a warning when
    there were no rows in the data frame being processed.
  * Fixed bug #6260. Accepted the change suggested by Claudius
    Loehnert, which was to replace { and } by \begingroup and
    \endgroup respectively as the delimiters when size was to changed
    in a table.
  * Added functions xtableList and print.xtableList to produce
    composite tables consisting of a number of subtables.
  * Added xtableFtable and print.xtableFtable to format flat tables
    produced by ftable. Included examples in the xtable gallery.
  * Produced new vignettes: 'The xtableList Gallery' to illustrate
    xtableList and print.xtableList; and 'The Other Packages Gallery'
    to illustrate methods for classes of objects from other packages.

1.8-0 (2015-11-02)
  * autoformat, xalign, xdigits, xdisplay from Arni Magnusson, added
    along with help file. Feature request #5686.
  * New argument 'auto' in xtable(), to call xalign, xdigits, and
    xdisplay at the time when xtable is created.
  * Updated xtableGallery vignette, now with TOC and revised examples.

1.7-4 (2014-09-11)
  * Changed tags in HTML to be all lower case, to be compatible with
    HTML5, part of feature request. (#5879)
  * Fixed booktabs bug (#2309), more of an enhancement really. Updated
    xtableGallery.snw to illustrate the change.

1.7-3 (2014-03-06)
  * Dealt with format.args bug (#4770). No code changes, but the
    documentation of print.xtable was changed to warn of the problem
    and to give a workaround as an example.

1.7-1 (2013-02-24)
  * Fixed logicals bug. (Req #1911)
  * Changed implementation of centering of tables. Instead of
    inserting a centered environment, now a \centering command is
    inserted. (Req #2104)
  * Allow for margin tables as possible with document class
    tufte-handout. An example of usage is found in the vignette.
    produced by margintable.Rnw which is in inst/doc. (Req #2168)
  * Added "timestamp" argument to print.xtable().  Set it to NULL
    if no timestamp is desired. (Req #2246)
  * Added "comment" argument to print.xtable().  Set it to FALSE
    to exclude the version and timestamp comment. (Req #2246)
  * Added "caption.width" argument.  If not NULL then the caption
    is placed in a "parbox" of the specified width. (Req #2247)
  * Remove the check on whether the "floating.environment" is in a
    list of known floating environments. Users want to use floating
    environments from multiple options LaTeX packages. (Req #2488,
    #2578)

1.7-0 (2012-02-10)
  * Added some vectorization code to improve performance.
  * Let "caption" be length 2, in which case the second value is
    the short caption used when creating a list of tables.
  * Added "toLatex" method.
  * Included "print.xtable" in the exported methods in the NAMESPACE file.
  * Added "print.results" argument to "print" that can be used to
    suppress the printing.
  * Added "format.args" argument to "print" that can be used to
    pass additional arguments such as "big.marks" to "formatC()".
  * Added "rotate.colnames" and "rotate.rownames" arguments to
    "print.xtable".
  * Added "booktabs" argument to use the "\toprule", "\midrule", and
    "\bottomrule" tags from the Latex "booktabs" package rather than
    using "\hline" for all horizontal lines.
  * Added "scalebox" argument to include a "\scalebox" clause around
    the tabular environment with the specified value used as the
    scaling factor.
  * Added "width" argument to allow specification of the width
    value in tabular environments such as "tabularx".
  * Added "X" as an allowed alignment value in the "align()"
    replacement function.
  * Changed the "print.xtable()" arguments to use "getOption()"
    to check the options for a default value.  This was suggested
    since "print.xtable()" has a lot of arguments that the user
    will typically leave unchanged between tables.
  * Added an "is.null()" check on the "table.placement" argument.
  * Added examples using the new arguments to the vignette.

1.6-0 (2011-10-07)
  * Allow "table*" as a value for "floating.environment" in print.xtable().
  * Fix bug under which multiple logical columns were formatted incorrectly.
  * Stop with an error if "xtable.table" is used on a table with more than
    two dimensions.
  * Add some newlines to "Rd" file to prevent lines from extending off the
    page in the PDF version of the help files.
  * Changed the maintainer to "Charles Roosen".
  * Created an "xtable" project on R-Forge.

1.5-6 (2009-10-30)
  * Support caption at the top in the LaTeX longtable.
  * Use options()$OutDec for decimal mark.

1.5-5 (2009-03-24)
  * Added html.table.attributes to set the attributed of the <TABLE> tag for
    HTML tables.
  * Accommodated logicals by converting to characters.
  * Add an extra space at end of each line for LaTeX tables.
  * Fixed typographical error in documentation.
