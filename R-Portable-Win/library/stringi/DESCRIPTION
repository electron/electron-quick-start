Version: 1.1.5

Title: Character String Processing Facilities
Description: Allows for fast, correct, consistent, portable,
    as well as convenient character string/text processing in every locale
    and any native encoding. Owing to the use of the ICU library,
    the package provides R users with platform-independent functions
    known to Java, Perl, Python, PHP, and Ruby programmers. Available
    features include: pattern searching (e.g., with ICU Java-like regular
    expressions or the Unicode Collation Algorithm), random string generation,
    case mapping, string transliteration, concatenation,
    Unicode normalization, date-time formatting and parsing, etc.
