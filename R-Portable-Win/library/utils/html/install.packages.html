argument if your repository mirror is incomplete, e.g., because
you burned only the &lsquo;<span class="file">contrib</span>&rsquo; section on a CD, or only have
binary packages.  Overrides argument <code>repos</code>.

Can also be a character vector, a subset of
<code>c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo", "Suggests", "Enhances")</code>.
</p>
<p>Only supported if <code>lib</code> is of length one (or missing),
so it is unambiguous where to install the dependent packages.  If
this is not the case it is ignored, with a warning.
</p>
<p>The default, <code>NA</code>, means
<code>c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo")</code>.
</p>
<p><code>TRUE</code> means to use
<code>c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo", "Suggests")</code> for
<code>pkgs</code> and

concatenated into a single string (separated by a space) and used as
the value for the <span class="option">--configure-args</span> flag in the call to
<code>R CMD INSTALL</code>.  If the character vector has names these
are assumed to identify values for <span class="option">--configure-args</span> for
individual packages.  This allows one to specify settings for an
entire collection of packages which will be used if any of those
packages are to be installed.  (These settings can therefore be
re-used and act as default settings.)
</p>
<p>A named list can be used also to the same effect, and that

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is the main function to install packages.  It takes a vector of
names and a destination library, downloads the packages from the
repositories and installs them.  (If the library is omitted it
defaults to the first directory in <code>.libPaths()</code>, with a message
if there is more than one.)  If <code>lib</code> is omitted or is of length
one and is not a (group) writable directory, in interactive use the
code offers to create a personal library tree (the first element of
<code>Sys.getenv("R_LIBS_USER")</code>) and install there.
</p>
<p>Detection of a writable directory is problematic on Windows: see the
&lsquo;Note&rsquo; section.
</p>
<p>For installs from a repository an attempt is made to install the
packages in an order that respects their dependencies.  This does
assume that all the entries in <code>lib</code> are on the default library
path for installs (set by environment variable <span class="env">R_LIBS</span>).
</p>
<p>You are advised to run <code>update.packages</code> before
<code>install.packages</code> to ensure that any already installed
dependencies have their latest versions.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Invisible <code>NULL</code>.
</p>


<h3>Binary packages</h3>

<p>This section applies only to platforms where binary packages are
available: Windows and CRAN builds for macOS.
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> packages are primarily distributed as <em>source</em> packages, but
<em>binary</em> packages (a packaging up of the installed package) are
also supported, and the type most commonly used on Windows and by the
CRAN builds for macOS.  This function can install either type, either by
downloading a file from a repository or from a local file.
</p>
<p>Possible values of <code>type</code> are (currently) <code>"source"</code>,
<code>"mac.binary"</code>, <code>"mac.binary.el-capitan"</code> and
<code>"win.binary"</code>: the appropriate binary type where supported can
also be selected as <code>"binary"</code>.
</p>
<p>For a binary install from a repository, the function checks for the
availability of a source package on the same repository, and reports
if the source package has a later version, or is available but no
binary version is.  This check can be suppressed by using
</p>
<pre>    options(install.packages.check.source = "no")</pre>
<p>and should be if there is a partial repository containing only binary
files.
</p>
<p>An alternative (and the current default) is <code>"both"</code> which means
&lsquo;use binary if available and current, otherwise try
source&rsquo;. The action if there are source packages which are preferred
but may contain code which needs to be compiled is controlled by
<code><a href="../../base/html/options.html">getOption</a>("install.packages.compile.from.source")</code>.
<code>type = "both"</code> will be silently changed to <code>"binary"</code> if
either <code>contriburl</code> or <code>available</code> is specified.
</p>
<p>Using packages with <code>type = "source"</code> always works provided the
package contains no C/C++/Fortran code that needs compilation.
Otherwise,
</p>

<dl>
<dt>on Windows</dt><dd><p>you will need to have installed the Rtools
collection as described in the &lsquo;R for Windows FAQ&rsquo; <em>and</em>
you must have the <span class="env">PATH</span> environment variable set up as required
by Rtools.
</p>
<p>For a 32/64-bit installation of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> on Windows, a small minority of
packages with compiled code need either <code>INSTALL_opts =
  "--force-biarch"</code> or <code>INSTALL_opts = "--merge-multiarch"</code> for a
source installation.  (It is safe to always set the latter when
installing from a repository or tarballs, although it will be a little
slower.)
</p>
<p>When installing a binary package, <code>install.packages</code> will abort
the install if it detects that the package is already installed and is
currently in use.  In some circumstances (e.g., multiple instances of
<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> running at the same time and sharing a library) it will not detect a
problem, but the installation may fail as Windows locks files in use.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>On Unix-alikes,</dt><dd><p>when the package contains C/C++/Fortran code
that needs compilation, on macOS you need to have installed the
&lsquo;Command-line tools for Xcode&rsquo; (see the &lsquo;R Installation
and Administration Manual&rsquo;) and if needed by the package a Fortran
compiler, and have them in your path.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Locking</h3>

<p>There are various options for locking: these differ between source and
binary installs.
</p>
<p>By default for a source install, the library directory is
&lsquo;locked&rsquo; by creating a directory &lsquo;<span class="file">00LOCK</span>&rsquo; within it.  This
has two purposes: it prevents any other process installing into that
library concurrently, and is used to store any previous version of the
package to restore on error.  A finer-grained locking is provided by
the option <span class="option">--pkglock</span> which creates a separate lock for each
package: this allows enough freedom for parallel
installation.  Per-package locking is the default when installing a
single package, and for multiple packages when <code>Ncpus &gt; 1L</code>.
Finally locking (and restoration on error) can be suppressed by
<span class="option">--no-lock</span>.

</p>
<p>For a macOS binary install, no locking is done by default.  Setting
argument <code>lock</code> to <code>TRUE</code> (it defaults to the value of
<code><a href="../../base/html/options.html">getOption</a>("install.lock", FALSE)</code>) will use per-directory
locking as described for source installs.  For Windows binary install,
per-directory locking is used by default (<code>lock</code> defaults to the
value of <code><a href="../../base/html/options.html">getOption</a>("install.lock", TRUE)</code>).  If the value is
<code>"pkglock"</code> per-package locking will be used.
</p>
<p>If package locking is used on Windows with <code>libs_only = TRUE</code> and
the installation fails, the package will be restored to its previous
state.
</p>
<p>Note that it is possible for the package installation to fail so badly
that the lock directory is not removed: this inhibits any further
installs to the library directory (or for <code>--pkglock</code>, of the
package) until the lock directory is removed manually.
</p>


<h3>Parallel installs</h3>

<p>Parallel installs are attempted if <code>pkgs</code> has length greater than
one and <code>Ncpus &gt; 1</code>.  It makes use of a parallel <code>make</code>,
so the <code>make</code> specified (default <code>make</code>) when <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> was
built must be capable of supporting <code>make -j <var>n</var></code>: GNU make,
<code>dmake</code> and <code>pmake</code> do, but Solaris <code>make</code> and
older FreeBSD <code>make</code> do not: if necessary environment variable
<span class="env">MAKE</span> can be set for the current session to select a suitable
<code>make</code>.
</p>
<p><code>install.packages</code> needs to be able to compute all the
dependencies of <code>pkgs</code> from <code>available</code>, including if one
element of <code>pkgs</code> depends indirectly on another.  This means that
if for example you are installing <acronym><span class="acronym">CRAN</span></acronym> packages which depend
on Bioconductor packages which in turn depend on <acronym><span class="acronym">CRAN</span></acronym>
packages, <code>available</code> needs to cover both <acronym><span class="acronym">CRAN</span></acronym> and
Bioconductor packages.
</p>


<h3>Timeouts</h3>

<p>A limit on the elapsed time for each call to <code>R CMD INSTALL</code>
(so for source installs) can be set <em>via</em> environment variable
<span class="env">_R_INSTALL_PACKAGES_ELAPSED_TIMEOUT_</span>: in seconds (or in minutes
or hours with optional suffix <span class="samp">m</span> or <span class="samp">h</span>, suffix <span class="samp">s</span>
being allowed for the default seconds) with <code>0</code> meaning no limit.
</p>
<p>For non-parallel installs this is implemented <em>via</em> the
<code>timeout</code> argument of <code><a href="../../base/html/system2.html">system2</a></code>: for parallel
installs <em>via</em> the OS's <code>timeout</code> command.  (The one
tested is from GNU <span class="pkg">coreutils</span>, commonly available on Linux but
not other Unix-alikes.  If no such command is available the timeout
request is ignored, with a warning.)  For parallel installs a
<span class="samp">Error 124</span> message from <code>make</code> indicates that timeout
occurred.
</p>
<p>Timeouts during installation might leave lock directories behind and
not restore previous versions.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>


<dl>
<dt>On Unix-alikes:</dt><dd>
<p>Some binary distributions of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> have <code>INSTALL</code> in a separate
bundle, e.g. an <code>R-devel</code> RPM.  <code>install.packages</code> will
give an error if called with <code>type = "source"</code> on such a system.
</p>
<p>Some binary Linux distributions of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> can be installed on a machine
without the tools needed to install packages: a possible remedy is to
do a complete install of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> which should bring in all those tools as
dependencies.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>On Windows:</dt><dd>
<p><code>install.packages</code> tries to detect if you have write permission
on the library directories specified, but Windows reports unreliably.
If there is only one library directory (the default), <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> tries to
find out by creating a test directory, but even this need not be the
whole story: you may have permission to write in a library directory
but lack permission to write binary files (such as &lsquo;<span class="file">.dll</span>&rsquo; files)
there.  See the &lsquo;R for Windows FAQ&rsquo; for workarounds.
