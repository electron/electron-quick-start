<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This will stop at the first error, so if you want all the <code>pkgs</code>
to be tried, call this via a shell loop.
</p>
<p>If used as <code>R CMD INSTALL pkgs</code> without explicitly specifying
<code>lib</code>, packages are installed into the library tree rooted at the
first directory in the library path which would be used by <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> run in
the current environment.
</p>
<p>To install into the library tree <code><var>lib</var></code>, use
<code>R CMD INSTALL -l <var>lib</var> <var>pkgs</var></code>.
This prepends <code>lib</code> to the library path for
duration of the install, so required packages in the installation
directory will be found (and used in preference to those in other
libraries).
</p>
<p>It is possible that environment variable <span class="env">TMPDIR</span>
will need to be set (although <code>R CMD</code> tries to set it suitably
otherwise): use forward slashes and no spaces for the path to a
writable directory.
</p>
<p>Both <code>lib</code> and the elements of <code>pkgs</code> may be absolute or
relative path names of directories.  <code>pkgs</code> may also contain
names of package archive files: these are then extracted to a
temporary directory.  These are tarballs containing a single
directory, optionally compressed by <code>gzip</code>, <code>bzip2</code>,
<code>xz</code> or <code>compress</code>.
Finally, zipped binary packages (as created by
<code>R CMD INSTALL --build</code>) can be supplied.
</p>
<p>Tarballs are by default unpackaged by the internal <code><a href="untar.html">untar</a></code>
function: if needed an external <code>tar</code> command can be specified
by the environment variable <span class="env">R_INSTALL_TAR</span>: please ensure that it
can handle the type of compression used on the tarball.  (This is
sometimes needed for tarballs containing invalid or unsupported
sections, and can be faster on very large tarballs.   Setting
<span class="env">R_INSTALL_TAR</span> to <span class="samp">tar.exe</span> has been needed to overcome
permissions issues on some Windows systems.)
</p>
<p>The package sources can be cleaned up prior to installation by
<span class="option">--preclean</span> or after by <span class="option">--clean</span>: cleaning is
essential if the sources are to be used with more than one
architecture or platform.
</p>
<p>If the attempt to install the package fails, leftovers are removed.
If the package was already installed, the old version is restored.
This happens either if a command encounters an error or if the
install is interrupted from the keyboard: after cleaning up the script
terminates.
</p>
<p>For details of the locking which is done, see the section
&lsquo;Locking&rsquo; in the help for <code><a href="install.packages.html">install.packages</a></code>.
</p>
<p>Option <span class="option">--build</span> can be used to zip up the installed package
for distribution.
</p>
<p>By default a package is installed with static HTML help pages if and
only if <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> was: use options <span class="option">--html</span> and <span class="option">--no-html</span> to
override this.
</p>
<p>Packages are not by default installed keeping the source formatting
(see the <code>keep.source</code> argument to <code><a href="../../base/html/source.html">source</a></code>): this
can be enabled by the option <span class="option">--with-keep.source</span> or by setting
environment variable <span class="env">R_KEEP_PKG_SOURCE</span> to <code>yes</code>.
</p>
<p>Use <code>R CMD INSTALL --help</code> for concise usage information,
including all the available options.
</p>


<h3>Sub-architectures</h3>

<p>An <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> installation can support more than one sub-architecture:
currently this is most commonly used for 32- and 64-bit builds on
Windows.
</p>
<p>For such installations, the default behaviour is to try to install
source packages for all installed sub-architectures unless the package
has a configure script or a &lsquo;<span class="file">src/Makefile</span>&rsquo; (or
&lsquo;<span class="file">src/Makefile.win</span>&rsquo; on Windows), when only compiled code for the
sub-architecture running <code>R CMD INSTALL</code> is installed.
</p>
<p>To install a source package with compiled code only for the
sub-architecture used by <code>R CMD INSTALL</code>, use
<span class="option">--no-multiarch</span>.  To install just the compiled code for
another sub-architecture, use <span class="option">--libs-only</span>.
</p>
<p>There are two ways to install for all available sub-architectures.  If
the configure script is known to work for both Windows architectures,
use flag <span class="option">--force-biarch</span> (and packages can specify this
<em>via</em> a <span class="samp">Biarch: yes</span> field in their <code>DESCRIPTION</code> files).
Second, a single tarball can be installed with
</p>
<pre>R CMD INSTALL --merge-multiarch mypkg_version.tar.gz</pre>


<h3>Staged installation</h3>

<p>The default way to install source packages changed in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> 3.6.0, so
packages are first installed to a temporary location and then (if
successful) moved to the destination library directory.  Some older
packages were written in ways that assume direct installation to the
destination library.
</p>
<p>Staged installation can currently be overridden by having a line
<span class="samp">StagedInstall: no</span> in the package's &lsquo;<span class="file">DESCRIPTION</span>&rsquo; file,
<em>via</em> flag <span class="option">--no-staged-install</span> or by setting environment
variable <span class="env">R_INSTALL_STAGED</span> to a false value
(e.g. <span class="samp">false</span> or <span class="samp">no</span>).
</p>
<p>Staged installation requires either <span class="option">--pkglock</span> or
<span class="option">--lock</span>, one of which is used by default.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The options do not have to precede <span class="samp">pkgs</span> on the command line,
although it will be more legible if they do.  All the options are
processed before any packages, and where options have conflicting
effects the last one will win.
