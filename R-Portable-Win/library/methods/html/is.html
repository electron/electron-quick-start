<h2>Is an Object from a Class?</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functions to test inheritance relationships between an object and a
class or between two classes (<code>extends</code>).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
is(object, class2)

extends(class1, class2, maybe = TRUE, fullInfo = FALSE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>any <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> object.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>class1, class2</code></td>
<td>

<p>the names of the classes between which <code>is</code> relations are to be
examined defined, or (more efficiently) the class definition
objects for the classes.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>fullInfo</code></td>
<td>

<p>In a call to <code>extends</code>, with <code>class2</code> missing,
<code>fullInfo</code> is a flag, which if <code>TRUE</code> causes a list of
objects of class <code><a href="SClassExtension-class.html">SClassExtension</a></code> to be returned, rather than
just the names of the classes.  Only the distance slot is likely to
be useful in practice; see the &lsquo;Selecting Superclasses&rsquo; section;
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>maybe</code></td>
<td>

<p>What to return for conditional inheritance.  But such
relationships are rarely used and not recommended, so this
argument should not be needed.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Selecting Superclasses</h3>

<p>A call to  <code><a href="selectSuperClasses.html">selectSuperClasses</a>(cl)</code> returns a list of
superclasses, similarly to
<code>extends(cl)</code>.  Additional arguments restrict the class names
returned to direct superclasses and/or to non-virtual classes.
</p>
<p>Either way, programming with the result, particularly using
<code><a href="../../base/html/lapply.html">sapply</a></code>, can be useful.
</p>
<p>To find superclasses with more generally defined properties, one can program
with the result returned by <code>extends</code> when called with one
class as argument.
By default, the call returns a character vector including the name of the class
itself and of all its superclasses.
Alternatively,
if <code>extends</code> is called with <code>fullInfo =
    TRUE</code>, the return value is a named list, its names being the previous
character vector.  The elements of the list corresponding to
superclasses are objects of class
<code><a href="SClassExtension-class.html">SClassExtension</a></code>. Of the information in these objects, one piece can be useful:
the number of generations between the classes, given by the
<code>"distance"</code> slot.
</p>
<p>Programming with the result of the call to <code>extends</code>, particularly using
<code><a href="../../base/html/lapply.html">sapply</a></code>, can select superclasses.
The programming technique is to define a test function that returns
<code>TRUE</code> for superclasses or relationships obeying some
requirement. For example, to find only next-to-direct superclasses,
use this function with the list of extension objects:
</p>
<p><code>function(what) is(what, "SClassExtension") &amp;&amp; what@distance == 2</code>
</p>
<p>or, to find only superclasses from <code>"myPkg"</code>, use this function
with the simple vector of names:
</p>
<p><code>function(what) getClassDef(what)@package == "myPkg"</code>
</p>
<p>Giving such functions as an argument to <code><a href="../../base/html/lapply.html">sapply</a></code> called on the output of
<code>extends</code> allows you to find
superclasses with desired properties.  See the examples below.
</p>
<p>Note that the function using extension objects must test the class of its argument since,
unfortunately for this purpose, the list returned by <code>extends</code> includes
<code>class1</code> itself, as the object <code>TRUE</code>.

<p>Although <code><a href="../../base/html/class.html">inherits</a></code> is defined for S3 classes, it has
been modified so that the result returned is nearly always equivalent to
<code>is</code>, both for S4 and non-S4 objects. Since it is implemented
in C, it is somewhat faster.
The only non-equivalences arise from use of <code><a href="setIs.html">setIs</a></code>,
which should rarely be encountered.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
## Not run: 
## this example can be run if package XRPython from CRAN is installed.
supers &lt;- extends("PythonInterface")
## find all the superclasses from package XR
fromXR &lt;- sapply(supers,
    function(what) getClassDef(what)@package == "XR")
## print them
supers[fromXR]

## find all the superclasses at distance 2
superRelations &lt;- extends("PythonInterface", fullInfo = TRUE)
dist2 &lt;- sapply(superRelations,
    function(what) is(what, "SClassExtension") &amp;&amp; what@distance == 2)
## print them
names(superRelations)[dist2]


## End(Not run)
