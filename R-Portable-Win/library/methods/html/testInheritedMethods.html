<h2>
Test for and Report about  Selection of Inherited Methods
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A set of distinct inherited signatures is generated to test
inheritance for all the methods of a specified generic function.  If
method selection is ambiguous for some of these, a summary of the
ambiguities is attached to the returned object.  This test should be
performed by package authors <em>before</em> releasing a package.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
testInheritedMethods(f, signatures, test = TRUE, virtual = FALSE,
                     groupMethods = TRUE, where = .GlobalEnv)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>f</code></td>
<td>
<p>a generic function or the character string name of one.  By default,
all currently defined subclasses of all the method signatures for this
generic will be examined.  The other arguments are mainly options to
modify which inheritance patterns will be examined.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>signatures</code></td>
<td>

<p>An optional set of subclass signatures to use instead of the relevant
subclasses computed by <code>testInheritedMethods</code>.  See the Details
for how this is done.  This argument might be supplied after a call
with <code>test = FALSE</code>, to test selection in batches.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>test</code></td>
<td>

<p>optional flag to control whether method selection is actually tested.
If <code>FALSE</code>, returns just the list of relevant signatures for
subclasses, without calling <code><a href="getMethod.html">selectMethod</a></code> for each signature.
If there are a very large number of signatures, you may want to collect the full list  and then test them in batches.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>virtual</code></td>
<td>

<p>should virtual classes be included in the relevant subclasses.
Normally not, since only the classes of actual arguments will trigger
the inheritance calculation in a call to the generic function.
Including virtual classes may be useful if the class has no current
non-virtual subclasses but you anticipate your users may define such
classes in the future.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>groupMethods</code></td>
<td>

<p>should methods for the group generic function be included?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>where</code></td>
<td>

<p>the environment in which to look for class definitions.  Nearly
always, use the default global environment after attaching all the
packages with relevant methods and/or class definitions.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The following description applies when the optional arguments are
omitted, the usual case.
First, the defining signatures for all methods are computed by calls
to <code><a href="findMethods.html">findMethodSignatures</a></code>.
From these all the known non-virtual subclasses are found for each
class that appears in the signature of some method.
These subclasses are split into groups according to which class they
inherit from, and only one subclass from each group is retained (for
each argument in the generic signature).
So if a method was defined with class <code>"vector"</code> for some
argument, one actual vector class is chosen arbitrarily.
The case of <code>"ANY"</code> is dealt with specially, since all classes
extend it.  A dummy, nonvirtual class, <code>".Other"</code>, is used to
correspond to all classes that have no superclasses among those being
tested.
</p>
<p>All combinations of retained subclasses for the
arguments in the generic signature are then computed.
Each row of the resulting matrix is a signature to be tested by a call
to <code><a href="getMethod.html">selectMethod</a></code>.
To collect information on ambiguous selections,
<code>testInheritedMethods</code> establishes a calling handler for the
special signal <code>"ambiguousMethodSelection"</code>, by setting the
corresponding option.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>"methodSelectionReport"</code>.  The details of
this class are currently subject to change.  It has slots
<code>"target"</code>, <code>"selected"</code>, <code>"candidates"</code>, and
<code>"note"</code>, all referring to the ambiguous cases (and so of length
0 if there were none).  These slots are intended to be examined by the
programmer to detect and preferably fix ambiguous method selections.
The object contains in addition slots <code>"generic"</code>, the name of
the generic function, and
<code>"allSelections"</code>,  giving the vector of labels for all
the signatures tested.
