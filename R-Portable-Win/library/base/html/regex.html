<h2>Regular Expressions as used in R</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This help page documents the regular expression patterns supported by
<code><a href="grep.html">grep</a></code> and related functions <code>grepl</code>, <code>regexpr</code>,
<code>gregexpr</code>, <code>sub</code> and <code>gsub</code>, as well as by
<code><a href="strsplit.html">strsplit</a></code>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A &lsquo;regular expression&rsquo; is a pattern that describes a set of
strings.  Two types of regular expressions are used in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>,
<em>extended</em> regular expressions (the default) and
<em>Perl-like</em> regular expressions used by <code>perl = TRUE</code>.
There is also <code>fixed = TRUE</code> which can be considered to use a
<em>literal</em> regular expression.
</p>
<p>Other functions which use regular expressions (often via the use of
<code>grep</code>) include <code>apropos</code>, <code>browseEnv</code>,
<code>help.search</code>, <code>list.files</code> and <code>ls</code>.
These will all use <em>extended</em> regular expressions.
</p>
<p>Patterns are described here as they would be printed by <code>cat</code>:
(<em>do remember that backslashes need to be doubled when entering <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>
character strings</em>, e.g. from the keyboard).
</p>
<p>Long regular expression patterns may or may not be accepted: the POSIX
standard only requires up to 256 <em>bytes</em>.
</p>


<h3>Extended Regular Expressions</h3>

<p>This section covers the regular expressions allowed in the default
mode of <code>grep</code>, <code>grepl</code>, <code>regexpr</code>, <code>gregexpr</code>,
<code>sub</code>, <code>gsub</code>, <code>regexec</code> and <code>strsplit</code>.  They use
an implementation of the POSIX 1003.2 standard: that allows some scope
for interpretation and the interpretations here are those currently
used by <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>.  The implementation supports some extensions to the
standard.
</p>
<p>Regular expressions are constructed analogously to arithmetic
expressions, by using various operators to combine smaller
expressions.  The whole expression matches zero or more characters
(read &lsquo;character&rsquo; as &lsquo;byte&rsquo; if <code>useBytes = TRUE</code>).
</p>
<p>The fundamental building blocks are the regular expressions that match
a single character.  Most characters, including all letters and
digits, are regular expressions that match themselves.  Any
metacharacter with special meaning may be quoted by preceding it with
a backslash.  The metacharacters in extended regular expressions are
<span class="samp">. \ | ( ) [ { ^ $ * + ?</span>, but note that whether these have a
special meaning depends on the context.
</p>
<p>Escaping non-metacharacters with a backslash is
implementation-dependent.  The current implementation interprets
<span class="samp">\a</span> as <span class="samp">BEL</span>, <span class="samp">\e</span> as <span class="samp">ESC</span>, <span class="samp">\f</span> as
<span class="samp">FF</span>, <span class="samp">\n</span> as <span class="samp">LF</span>, <span class="samp">\r</span> as <span class="samp">CR</span> and
<span class="samp">\t</span> as <span class="samp">TAB</span>.  (Note that these will be interpreted by
<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>'s parser in literal character strings.)
</p>
<p>A <em>character class</em> is a list of characters enclosed between
<span class="samp">[</span> and <span class="samp">]</span> which matches any single character in that list;
unless the first character of the list is the caret <span class="samp">^</span>, when it
matches any character <em>not</em> in the list.  For example, the
regular expression <span class="samp">[0123456789]</span> matches any single digit, and
<span class="samp">[^abc]</span> matches anything except the characters <span class="samp">a</span>,
<span class="samp">b</span> or <span class="samp">c</span>.  A range of characters may be specified by
giving the first and last characters, separated by a hyphen.  (Because
their interpretation is locale- and implementation-dependent,
character ranges are best avoided.)  The only portable way to specify
all ASCII letters is to list them all as the character class<br />
<span class="samp">[ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz]</span>.<br /> (The
current implementation uses numerical order of the encoding.)
</p>
<p>Certain named classes of characters are predefined.  Their
interpretation depends on the <em>locale</em> (see <a href="locales.html">locales</a>); the
interpretation below is that of the POSIX locale.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="samp">[:alnum:]</span></dt><dd><p>Alphanumeric characters: <span class="samp">[:alpha:]</span>
and <span class="samp">[:digit:]</span>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="samp">[:alpha:]</span></dt><dd><p>Alphabetic characters: <span class="samp">[:lower:]</span> and
<span class="samp">[:upper:]</span>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="samp">[:blank:]</span></dt><dd><p>Blank characters: space and tab, and
possibly other locale-dependent characters such as non-breaking
space.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="samp">[:cntrl:]</span></dt><dd>
<p>Control characters.  In ASCII, these characters have octal codes
000 through 037, and 177 (<code>DEL</code>).  In another character set,
these are the equivalent characters, if any.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="samp">[:digit:]</span></dt><dd><p>Digits: <span class="samp">0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</span>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="samp">[:graph:]</span></dt><dd><p>Graphical characters: <span class="samp">[:alnum:]</span> and
<span class="samp">[:punct:]</span>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="samp">[:lower:]</span></dt><dd><p>Lower-case letters in the current locale.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="samp">[:print:]</span></dt><dd>
<p>Printable characters: <span class="samp">[:alnum:]</span>, <span class="samp">[:punct:]</span> and space.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="samp">[:punct:]</span></dt><dd><p>Punctuation characters:<br />
<span class="samp">! " # $ % &amp; ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; &lt; = &gt; ? @ [ \ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~</span>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><span class="samp">[:space:]</span></dt><dd>
<p>Space characters: tab, newline, vertical tab, form feed, carriage
return, space and possibly other locale-dependent characters.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="samp">[:upper:]</span></dt><dd><p>Upper-case letters in the current locale.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="samp">[:xdigit:]</span></dt><dd><p>Hexadecimal digits:<br />
<span class="samp">0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F a b c d e f</span>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>For example, <span class="samp">[[:alnum:]]</span> means <span class="samp">[0-9A-Za-z]</span>, except the
latter depends upon the locale and the character encoding, whereas the
former is independent of locale and character set.  (Note that the
brackets in these class names are part of the symbolic names, and must
be included in addition to the brackets delimiting the bracket list.)
Most metacharacters lose their special meaning inside a character
class.  To include a literal <span class="samp">]</span>, place it first in the list.
Similarly, to include a literal <span class="samp">^</span>, place it anywhere but first.
Finally, to include a literal <span class="samp">-</span>, place it first or last (or,
for <code>perl = TRUE</code> only, precede it by a backslash).  (Only
<span class="samp">^ - \ ]</span> are special inside character classes.)
</p>
<p>The period <span class="samp">.</span> matches any single character.  The symbol
<span class="samp">\w</span> matches a &lsquo;word&rsquo; character (a synonym for
<span class="samp">[[:alnum:]_]</span>, an extension) and <span class="samp">\W</span> is its negation
(<span class="samp">[^[:alnum:]_]</span>).  Symbols <span class="samp">\d</span>, <span class="samp">\s</span>, <span class="samp">\D</span>
and <span class="samp">\S</span> denote the digit and space classes and their negations
(these are all extensions).
</p>
<p>The caret <span class="samp">^</span> and the dollar sign <span class="samp">$</span> are metacharacters
that respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a
line.  The symbols <span class="samp">\&lt;</span> and <span class="samp">\&gt;</span> match the empty string at
the beginning and end of a word.  The symbol <span class="samp">\b</span> matches the
empty string at either edge of a word, and <span class="samp">\B</span> matches the
empty string provided it is not at an edge of a word.  (The
interpretation of &lsquo;word&rsquo; depends on the locale and
implementation: these are all extensions.)
</p>
<p>A regular expression may be followed by one of several repetition
quantifiers:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="samp">?</span></dt><dd><p>The preceding item is optional and will be matched
at most once.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="samp">*</span></dt><dd><p>The preceding item will be matched zero or more
times.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="samp">+</span></dt><dd><p>The preceding item will be matched one or more
times.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="samp">{n}</span></dt><dd><p>The preceding item is matched exactly <code>n</code>
times.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="samp">{n,}</span></dt><dd><p>The preceding item is matched <code>n</code> or more
times.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="samp">{n,m}</span></dt><dd><p>The preceding item is matched at least <code>n</code>
times, but not more than <code>m</code> times.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>By default repetition is greedy, so the maximal possible number of
repeats is used.  This can be changed to &lsquo;minimal&rsquo; by appending
<code>?</code> to the quantifier.  (There are further quantifiers that allow
approximate matching: see the TRE documentation.)
</p>
<p>Regular expressions may be concatenated; the resulting regular
expression matches any string formed by concatenating the substrings
that match the concatenated subexpressions.
</p>
<p>Two regular expressions may be joined by the infix operator <span class="samp">|</span>;
the resulting regular expression matches any string matching either
subexpression.   For example, <span class="samp">abba|cde</span> matches either the
string <code>abba</code> or the string <code>cde</code>.  Note that alternation
does not work inside character classes, where <span class="samp">|</span> has its literal
meaning.
</p>
<p>Repetition takes precedence over concatenation, which in turn takes
precedence over alternation.  A whole subexpression may be enclosed in
parentheses to override these precedence rules.
</p>
<p>The backreference <span class="samp">\N</span>, where <span class="samp">N = 1 ... 9</span>, matches
the substring previously matched by the Nth parenthesized
subexpression of the regular expression.  (This is an
extension for extended regular expressions: POSIX defines them only
for basic ones.)
</p>


<h3>Perl-like Regular Expressions</h3>

<p>The <code>perl = TRUE</code> argument to <code>grep</code>, <code>regexpr</code>,
<code>gregexpr</code>, <code>sub</code>, <code>gsub</code> and <code>strsplit</code> switches
to the PCRE library that implements regular expression pattern
matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5.x,
with just a few differences.
</p>
<p>For complete details please consult the man pages for PCRE (and not
PCRE2), especially <code>man pcrepattern</code> and <code>man
  pcreapi</code>, on your system or from the sources at
<a href="http://www.pcre.org">http://www.pcre.org</a>.  (The version in use can be found by
calling <code><a href="extSoftVersion.html">extSoftVersion</a></code>.  It need not be the version
described in the system's man page.  As PCRE has been feature-frozen
for some time (essentially 2012), the man pages at
<a href="http://www.pcre.org/original/doc/html/">http://www.pcre.org/original/doc/html/</a> should be a good match.)
</p>
<p>Perl regular expressions can be computed byte-by-byte or
(UTF-8) character-by-character: the latter is used in all multibyte
locales and if any of the inputs are marked as UTF-8 (see
<code><a href="Encoding.html">Encoding</a></code>).
</p>
<p>All the regular expressions described for extended regular expressions
are accepted except <span class="samp">\&lt;</span> and <span class="samp">\&gt;</span>: in Perl all backslashed
metacharacters are alphanumeric and backslashed symbols always are
interpreted as a literal character. <span class="samp">{</span> is not special if it
would be the start of an invalid interval specification.  There can be
more than 9 backreferences (but the replacement in <code><a href="grep.html">sub</a></code>
can only refer to the first 9).
</p>
<p>Character ranges are interpreted in the numerical order of the
characters, either as bytes in a single-byte locale or as Unicode code
points in UTF-8 mode.  So in either case <span class="samp">[A-Za-z]</span> specifies the
set of ASCII letters.
</p>
<p>In UTF-8 mode the named character classes only match ASCII characters:
see <span class="samp">\p</span> below for an alternative.
</p>
<p>The construct <span class="samp">(?...)</span> is used for Perl extensions in a variety
of ways depending on what immediately follows the <span class="samp">?</span>.
</p>
<p>Perl-like matching can work in several modes, set by the options
<span class="samp">(?i)</span> (caseless, equivalent to Perl's <span class="samp">/i</span>), <span class="samp">(?m)</span>
(multiline, equivalent to Perl's <span class="samp">/m</span>), <span class="samp">(?s)</span> (single line,
so a dot matches all characters, even new lines: equivalent to Perl's
<span class="samp">/s</span>) and <span class="samp">(?x)</span> (extended, whitespace data characters are
ignored unless escaped and comments are allowed: equivalent to Perl's
<span class="samp">/x</span>).  These can be concatenated, so for example, <span class="samp">(?im)</span>
sets caseless multiline matching.  It is also possible to unset these
options by preceding the letter with a hyphen, and to combine setting
and unsetting such as <span class="samp">(?im-sx)</span>.  These settings can be applied
within patterns, and then apply to the remainder of the pattern.
Additional options not in Perl include <span class="samp">(?U)</span> to set
&lsquo;ungreedy&rsquo; mode (so matching is minimal unless <span class="samp">?</span> is used
as part of the repetition quantifier, when it is greedy).  Initially
none of these options are set.
</p>
<p>If you want to remove the special meaning from a sequence of
characters, you can do so by putting them between <span class="samp">\Q</span> and
<span class="samp">\E</span>. This is different from Perl in that <span class="samp">$</span> and <span class="samp">@</span> are
handled as literals in <span class="samp">\Q...\E</span> sequences in PCRE, whereas in
Perl, <span class="samp">$</span> and <span class="samp">@</span> cause variable interpolation.
</p>
<p>The escape sequences <span class="samp">\d</span>, <span class="samp">\s</span> and <span class="samp">\w</span> represent
any decimal digit, space character and &lsquo;word&rsquo; character
(letter, digit or underscore in the current locale: in UTF-8 mode only
ASCII letters and digits are considered) respectively, and their
upper-case versions represent their negation.  Vertical tab was not
regarded as a space character in a <code>C</code> locale before PCRE 8.34.
Sequences <span class="samp">\h</span>, <span class="samp">\v</span>, <span class="samp">\H</span> and <span class="samp">\V</span> match
horizontal and vertical space or the negation.  (In UTF-8 mode, these
do match non-ASCII Unicode code points.)
</p>
<p>There are additional escape sequences: <span class="samp">\cx</span> is
<span class="samp">cntrl-x</span> for any <span class="samp">x</span>, <span class="samp">\ddd</span> is the
octal character (for up to three digits unless
interpretable as a backreference, as <span class="samp">\1</span> to <span class="samp">\7</span> always
are), and <span class="samp">\xhh</span> specifies a character by two hex digits.
In a UTF-8 locale, <span class="samp">\x{h...}</span> specifies a Unicode code point
by one or more hex digits.  (Note that some of these will be
interpreted by <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>'s parser in literal character strings.)
</p>
<p>Outside a character class, <span class="samp">\A</span> matches at the start of a
subject (even in multiline mode, unlike <span class="samp">^</span>), <span class="samp">\Z</span> matches
at the end of a subject or before a newline at the end, <span class="samp">\z</span>
matches only at end of a subject. and <span class="samp">\G</span> matches at first
matching position in a subject (which is subtly different from Perl's
end of the previous match).  <span class="samp">\C</span> matches a single
byte, including a newline, but its use is warned against.  In UTF-8
mode, <span class="samp">\R</span> matches any Unicode newline character (not just CR),
and <span class="samp">\X</span> matches any number of Unicode characters that form an
extended Unicode sequence.
</p>
<p>In UTF-8 mode, some Unicode properties may be supported via
<span class="samp">\p{xx}</span> and <span class="samp">\P{xx}</span> which match characters with and
without property <span class="samp">xx</span> respectively.  For a list of supported
properties see the PCRE documentation, but for example <span class="samp">Lu</span> is
&lsquo;upper case letter&rsquo; and <span class="samp">Sc</span> is &lsquo;currency symbol&rsquo;.
(This support depends on the PCRE library being compiled with
&lsquo;Unicode property support&rsquo; which can be checked <em>via</em>
<code><a href="pcre_config.html">pcre_config</a></code>.)
</p>
<p>The sequence <span class="samp">(?#</span> marks the start of a comment which continues
up to the next closing parenthesis.  Nested parentheses are not
permitted.  The characters that make up a comment play no part at all in
the pattern matching.
</p>
<p>If the extended option is set, an unescaped <span class="samp">#</span> character outside
a character class introduces a comment that continues up to the next
newline character in the pattern.
</p>
<p>The pattern <span class="samp">(?:...)</span> groups characters just as parentheses do
but does not make a backreference.
</p>
<p>Patterns <span class="samp">(?=...)</span> and <span class="samp">(?!...)</span> are zero-width positive and
negative lookahead <em>assertions</em>: they match if an attempt to
match the <code>...</code> forward from the current position would succeed
(or not), but use up no characters in the string being processed.
Patterns <span class="samp">(?&lt;=...)</span> and <span class="samp">(?&lt;!...)</span> are the lookbehind
equivalents: they do not allow repetition quantifiers nor <span class="samp">\C</span>
in <code>...</code>.
</p>
<p><code>regexpr</code> and <code>gregexpr</code> support &lsquo;named capture&rsquo;.  If
groups are named, e.g., <code>"(?&lt;first&gt;[A-Z][a-z]+)"</code> then the
positions of the matches are also returned by name.  (Named
backreferences are not supported by <code>sub</code>.)
</p>
<p>Atomic grouping, possessive qualifiers and conditional
and recursive patterns are not covered here.
