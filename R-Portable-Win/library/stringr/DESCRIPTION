Description: A consistent, simple and easy to use set of
    wrappers around the fantastic 'stringi' package. All function and
    argument names (and positions) are consistent, all functions deal with
    "NA"'s and zero length vectors in the same way, and the output from
    one function is easy to feed into the input of another.
