<h2>Graphical User Interface for Choosing HCL Color Palettes</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A graphical user interface (GUI) for viewing, manipulating, and choosing HCL
color palettes.
</p>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Computes palettes based on the HCL (hue-chroma-luminance) color model (as
implemented by <code>polarLUV</code>). The GUIs interface the palette
functions <code>qualitative_hcl</code> for qualitative palettes,
<code>sequential_hcl</code> for sequential palettes with a single or
multiple hues, and <code>diverging_hcl</code> for diverging palettes (composed
from two single-hue sequential palettes).
</p>
<p>Two different GUIs are implemented and can be selected using the function
input argument <code>gui</code> (<code>"tcltk"</code> or <code>"shiny"</code>). Both GUIs
allows for interactive modification of the arguments of the respective
palette-generating functions, i.e., starting/ending hue (wavelength, type of
color), minimal/maximal chroma (colorfulness), minimal maximal luminance
(brightness, amount of gray), and a power transformations that control how
quickly/slowly chroma and/or luminance are changed through the palette.
Subsets of the parameters may not be applicable depending on the type of
palette chosen. See <code>qualitative_hcl</code> and Zeileis et al. (2009) for
a more detailed explanation of the different arguments. Stauffer et al.
(2015) provide more examples and guidance.
</p>
<p>Optionally, active palette can be illustrated by using a range of examples
such as a map, heatmap, scatter plot, perspective 3D surface etc.
</p>
<p>To demonstrate different types of deficiencies, the active palette may be
desaturated (emulating printing on a grayscale printer) and collapsed to
emulate different types of color-blindness (without red-green or green-blue
contrasts) using the <code>simulate_cvd</code> functions.
</p>
<p><code>choose_palette</code> by default starts the Tcl/Tk version of the GUI while
<code>hclwizard</code> by default starts the shiny version. <code>hcl_wizard</code> is
an alias for <code>hclwizard</code>.
</p>



<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a palette-generating function with the selected arguments.
Thus, the returned function takes an integer argument and returns the
corresponding number of HCL colors by traversing HCL space through
interpolation of the specified hue/chroma/luminance/power values.

<h2>HCL Color Palettes</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Qualitative, sequential (single-hue and multi-hue), and diverging
color palettes based on the HCL (hue-chroma-luminance) color model.
</p>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The HCL (hue-chroma-luminance) color model is a perceptual color model
obtained by using polar coordinates in CIE <code>LUV</code> space
(i.e., <code>polarLUV</code>), where steps of equal size correspond to
approximately equal perceptual changes in color. By taking polar coordinates
the resulting three dimensions capture the three perceptual axes very well:
hue is the type of color, chroma the colorfulness compared
to the corresponding gray, and luminance the brightness. This makes it relatively
easy to create balanced palettes through trajectories in this HCL space.
In contrast, in the more commonly-used <code>HSV</code> (hue-saturation-value)
model (a simple transformation of <code>RGB</code>), the three axes are
confounded so that luminance changes along with the hue leading to very
unbalanced palettes (see <code>rainbow_hcl</code> for further illustrations).
</p>
<p>Three types of palettes are derived based on the HCL model: </p>

<ul>
<li><p> Qualitative: Designed for coding categorical information, i.e.,
where no particular ordering of categories is available and every color
should receive the same perceptual weight.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Sequential: Designed for coding ordered/numeric information, i.e.,
where colors go from high to low (or vice versa).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Diverging: Designed for coding numeric information around a central
neutral value, i.e., where colors diverge from neutral to two extremes.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>The corresponding functions are <code>qualitative_hcl</code>, <code>sequential_hcl</code>,
and <code>diverging_hcl</code>. Their construction principles are explained in more detail below.
At the core is the luminance axis (i.e., light-dark contrasts):
These are easily decoded by humans and matched to high-low differences in the underlying
data. Therefore, <code>sequential_hcl</code> palettes are always based on a <em>monotonic</em>
luminance sequence whereas the colors in a <code>qualitative_hcl</code> palette all have the
<em>same</em> luminance. Finally, <code>diverging_hcl</code> palettes use the same monotonic
luminance sequence in both &ldquo;arms&rdquo; of the palette, i.e., correspond to
two balanced sequential palettes diverging from the same neutral value.
The other two axes, hue and chroma, are used to enhance the luminance information and/or
to further discriminate the color.
</p>
<p>All three palette functions specify trajectories in HCL space and hence need either
single values or intervals of the coordinates <code>h</code>, <code>c</code>, <code>l</code>. Their
interfaces are always designed such that <code>h</code>, <code>c</code>, <code>l</code> can take vector
arguments (as needed) but alternatively or additionally <code>h1</code>/<code>h2</code>,
<code>c1</code>/<code>c2</code>/<code>cmax</code>, and <code>l1</code>/<code>l2</code> can be specified. If so,
the latter coordinates overwrite the former.
</p>
<p><code>qualitative_hcl</code> distinguishes the underlying categories by a sequence of
hues while keeping both chroma and luminance constant to give each color in the
resulting palette the same perceptual weight. Thus, <code>h</code> should be a pair of
hues (or equivalently <code>h1</code> and <code>h2</code> can be used) with the starting and
ending hue of the palette. Then, an equidistant sequence between these hues is
employed, by default spanning the full color wheel (i.e, the full 360 degrees).
Chroma <code>c</code> (or equivalently <code>c1</code>) and luminance <code>l</code> (or equivalently
<code>l1</code>) are constants.
</p>
<p><code>sequential_hcl</code> codes the underlying numeric values by a monotonic sequence
of increasing (or decreasing) luminance. Thus, the <code>l</code> argument should provide
a vector of length 2 with starting and ending luminance (equivalently, <code>l1</code> and
<code>l2</code> can be used). Without chroma (i.e., <code>c = 0</code>), this simply corresponds
to a grayscale palette like <code>gray.colors</code>. For adding chroma, a simple
strategy would be to pick a single hue (via <code>h</code> or <code>h1</code>) and then decrease
chroma from some value (<code>c</code> or <code>c1</code>) to zero (i.e., gray) along with
increasing luminance. For bringing out the extremes (a dark high-chroma color vs.
a light gray) this is already very effective. For distinguishing also colors in the
middle two strategies can be employed: (a) Hue can be varied as well by specifying an
interval of hues in <code>h</code> (or beginning hue <code>h1</code> and ending hue <code>h2</code>).
(b) Instead of a decreasing chroma a triangular chroma trajectory can be employed
from <code>c1</code> over <code>cmax</code> to <code>c2</code> (or equivalently a vector <code>c</code> of
length 3). This yields high-chroma colors in the middle of the palette that are
more easily distinguished from the dark and light extremes. Finally, instead of
employing linear trajectories, power transformations are supported in chroma and
luminance via a vector <code>power</code> (or separate <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code>). If
<code>power[2]</code> (or <code>p2</code>) for the luminance trajectory is missing, it defaults
to <code>power[1]</code>/<code>p1</code> from the chroma trajectory.
</p>
<p><code>diverging_hcl</code> codes the underlying numeric values by a triangular luminance
sequence with different hues in the left and in the right arm of the palette. Thus,
it can be seen as a combination of two sequential palettes with some restrictions:
(a) a single hue is used for each arm of the palette, (b) chroma and luminance trajectory
are balanced between the two arms, (c) the neutral central value has zero chroma.
To specify such a palette a vector of two hues <code>h</code> (or equivalently <code>h1</code>
and <code>h2</code>), either a single chroma value <code>c</code> (or <code>c1</code>) or a vector
of two chroma values <code>c</code> (or <code>c1</code> and <code>cmax</code>), a vector of two
luminances <code>l</code> (or <code>l1</code> and <code>l2</code>), and power parameter(s) <code>power</code>
(or <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code>) are used. For more flexible diverging palettes without
the restrictrictions above (and consequently more parameters)
<code>divergingx_hcl</code> is available. For backward compatibility, <code>diverge_hcl</code>
is a copy of <code>diverging_hcl</code>.
</p>
<p>To facilitate using HCL-based palettes a wide range of example palettes are
provided in the package and can be specified by a name instead of a set of
parameters/coordinates. The examples have been taken from the literature and many
approximate color palettes from other software packages such as ColorBrewer.org
(<span class="pkg">RColorBrewer</span>), CARTO colors (<span class="pkg">rcartocolor</span>), or <span class="pkg">scico</span>. The function
<code>hcl_palettes</code> can be used to query the available pre-specified palettes. It
comes with a <code>print</code> method (listing names and types), a <code>summary</code> method
(additionally listing the underlying parameters/coordinates), and a <code>plot</code>
method that creates a <code>swatchplot</code> with suitable labels.

<h2>Color Spectrum Plot</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Visualization of color palettes (given as hex codes) in HCL and/or RGB
coordinates.
</p>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function <code>specplot</code> transforms a given color palette in hex codes
into their HCL (<code>polarLUV</code>) and/or RGB
(<code>sRGB</code>) coordinates. As the hues for low-chroma
colors are not (or poorly) identified, by default a smoothing is applied to
the hues (<code>fix = TRUE</code>). Also, to avoid jumps from 0 to 360 or vice
versa, the hue coordinates are shifted suitably.
</p>
<p>By default (<code>plot = TRUE</code>), the resulting HCL and optionally RGB coordinates are
visualized by simple line plots along with the color palette <code>x</code>
itself.
</p>
<p>For comparing two palettes, <code>specplot(x, y)</code> can be used which adds
lines (dashed, by default) corresponding to the <code>y</code> palette HCL/RGB
coordinates in the display.
</p>



<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>specplot</code> invisibly returns a list with components
</p>
<table summary="R valueblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>HCL</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix of HCL coordinates,</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>RGB</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix of sRGB coordinates,</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>hex</code></td>
<td>
<p>original color palette <code>x</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>



<h2>Palette Plot in HCL Space</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Visualization of color palettes in HCL space projections.
</p>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function <code>hclplot</code> is an auxiliary function for illustrating
the trajectories of color palettes in two-dimensional HCL space projections.
It collapses over one of the three coordinates (either the hue H or the
luminance L) and displays a heatmap of colors combining the remaining
two dimensions. The coordinates for the given color palette are highlighted
to bring out its trajectory.
</p>
<p>The function <code>hclplot</code> has been designed to work well with the
<code>hcl_palettes</code> in this package. While it is possible to apply
it to other color palettes as well, the results might look weird or confusing
if these palettes are constructed very differently (e.g., as in the highly
saturated base R palettes).
</p>
<p>More specifically, the following palettes can be visualized well: </p>

<ul>
<li><p> Qualitative with (approximately) constant luminance. In this case,
<code>hclplot</code> shows a hue-chroma plane (in polar coordinates), keeping
luminance at a fixed level (by default displayed in the main title of
the plot). If the luminance is, in fact, not approximately constant,
the luminance varies along with hue and chroma, using a simple linear
function (fitted by least squares).
<code>hclplot</code> shows a chroma-luminance plane, keeping hue at a fixed
level (by default displayed in the main title of the plot). If the hue
is, in fact, not approximately constant, the hue varies along with
chroma and luminance, using a simple linear function (fitted by least
squares.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Diverging with two (approximately) constant hues: This case is
visualized with two back-to-back sequential displays.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>To infer the type of display to use, by default, the following heuristic is
used: If luminance is not approximately constant (range &gt; 10) and follows
rougly a triangular pattern, a diverging display is used. If luminance is
not constant and follows roughly a linear pattern, a sequential display is
used. Otherwise a qualitative display is used.
</p>



<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>hclplot</code> invisibly returns a matrix with the HCL coordinates corresponding to <code>x</code>.
