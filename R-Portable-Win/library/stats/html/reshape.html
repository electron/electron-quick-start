<h2>Reshape Grouped Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function reshapes a data frame between &lsquo;wide&rsquo; format with
repeated measurements in separate columns of the same record and
&lsquo;long&rsquo; format with the repeated measurements in separate
records.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
reshape(data, varying = NULL, v.names = NULL, timevar = "time",
        idvar = "id", ids = 1:NROW(data),
        times = seq_along(varying[[1]]),
        drop = NULL, direction, new.row.names = NULL,
        sep = ".",
        split = if (sep == "") {
            list(regexp = "[A-Za-z][0-9]", include = TRUE)
        } else {
            list(regexp = sep, include = FALSE, fixed = TRUE)}
        )

</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>varying</code></td>
<td>
<p>names of sets of variables in the wide format that
correspond to single variables in long format
(&lsquo;time-varying&rsquo;).  This is canonically a list of vectors of
variable names, but it can optionally be a matrix of names, or a
single vector of names.  In each case, the names can be replaced by
indices which are interpreted as referring to <code>names(data)</code>.
See &lsquo;Details&rsquo; for more details and options.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>v.names</code></td>
<td>
<p>names of variables in the long format that correspond
to multiple variables in the wide format.  See &lsquo;Details&rsquo;.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>timevar</code></td>
<td>
<p>the variable in long format that differentiates multiple
records from the same group or individual.  If more than one record
matches, the first will be taken (with a warning). </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>idvar</code></td>
<td>
<p>Names of one or more variables in long format that
identify multiple records from the same group/individual.  These
variables may also be present in wide format.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ids</code></td>
<td>
<p>the values to use for a newly created <code>idvar</code>
variable in long format.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>times</code></td>
<td>
<p>the values to use for a newly created <code>timevar</code>
variable in long format.  See &lsquo;Details&rsquo;.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>drop</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of names of variables to drop before reshaping.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>direction</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string, partially matched to either
<code>"wide"</code> to reshape to wide format, or <code>"long"</code> to reshape
to long format.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>new.row.names</code></td>
<td>
<p>character or <code>NULL</code>: a non-null value will be
used for the row names of the result.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>sep</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector of length 1, indicating a separating
character in the variable names in the wide format.  This is used for
guessing <code>v.names</code> and <code>times</code> arguments based on the
names in <code>varying</code>.  If <code>sep == ""</code>, the split is just before
the first numeral that follows an alphabetic character.  This is
also used to create variable names when reshaping to wide format.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>split</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list with three components, <code>regexp</code>,
<code>include</code>, and (optionally) <code>fixed</code>.  This allows an
extended interface to variable name splitting.  See &lsquo;Details&rsquo;.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The arguments to this function are described in terms of longitudinal
data, as that is the application motivating the functions.  A
&lsquo;wide&rsquo; longitudinal dataset will have one record for each
individual with some time-constant variables that occupy single
columns and some time-varying variables that occupy a column for each
time point.  In &lsquo;long&rsquo; format there will be multiple records
for each individual, with some variables being constant across these
records and others varying across the records.  A &lsquo;long&rsquo; format
dataset also needs a &lsquo;time&rsquo; variable identifying which time
point each record comes from and an &lsquo;id&rsquo; variable showing which
records refer to the same person.
</p>
<p>If the data frame resulted from a previous <code>reshape</code> then the
operation can be reversed simply by <code>reshape(a)</code>.  The
<code>direction</code> argument is optional and the other arguments are
stored as attributes on the data frame.
</p>
<p>If <code>direction = "wide"</code> and no <code>varying</code> or <code>v.names</code>
arguments are supplied it is assumed that all variables except
<code>idvar</code> and <code>timevar</code> are time-varying.  They are all
expanded into multiple variables in wide format.
</p>
<p>If <code>direction = "long"</code> the <code>varying</code> argument can be a vector
of column names (or a corresponding index).  The function will attempt
to guess the <code>v.names</code> and <code>times</code> from these names.  The
default is variable names like <code>x.1</code>, <code>x.2</code>, where
<code>sep = "."</code> specifies to split at the dot and drop it from the
name.  To have alphabetic followed by numeric times use <code>sep = ""</code>.
</p>
<p>Variable name splitting as described above is only attempted in the
case where <code>varying</code> is an atomic vector, if it is a list or a
matrix, <code>v.names</code> and <code>times</code> will generally need to be
specified, although they will default to, respectively, the first
variable name in each set, and sequential times.
</p>
<p>Also, guessing is not attempted if <code>v.names</code> is given
explicitly.  Notice that the order of variables in <code>varying</code> is
like <code>x.1</code>,<code>y.1</code>,<code>x.2</code>,<code>y.2</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>split</code> argument should not usually be necessary.  The
<code>split$regexp</code> component is passed to either
<code><a href="../../base/html/strsplit.html">strsplit</a></code> or <code><a href="../../base/html/grep.html">regexpr</a></code>, where the latter is
used if <code>split$include</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, in which case the
splitting occurs after the first character of the matched string.  In
the <code><a href="../../base/html/strsplit.html">strsplit</a></code> case, the separator is not included in the
result, and it is possible to specify fixed-string matching using
<code>split$fixed</code>.
</p>

##  unbalanced 'long' data leads to NA fill in 'wide' form
df2 &lt;- df[1:7, ]

## Alternative regular expressions for guessing names
