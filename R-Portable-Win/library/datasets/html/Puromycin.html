<h2>Reaction Velocity of an Enzymatic Reaction</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>Puromycin</code> data frame has 23 rows and 3 columns of the
reaction velocity versus substrate concentration in an enzymatic
reaction involving untreated cells or cells treated with Puromycin.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>Puromycin</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This data frame contains the following columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>conc</code></dt><dd>
<p>a numeric vector of substrate concentrations (ppm)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>rate</code></dt><dd>
<p>a numeric vector of instantaneous reaction rates (counts/min/min)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>state</code></dt><dd>
<p>a factor with levels
<code>treated</code>
<code>untreated</code>
</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data on the velocity of an enzymatic reaction were obtained
by Treloar (1974).  The number of counts per minute of radioactive
product from the reaction was measured as a function of substrate
concentration in parts per million (ppm) and from these counts the
initial rate (or velocity) of the reaction was calculated
(counts/min/min).  The experiment was conducted once with the enzyme
treated with Puromycin, and once with the enzyme untreated.
