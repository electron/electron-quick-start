<h2>QC Checks for R Code and/or Documentation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functions for performing various quality control (QC) checks on R code
and documentation, notably on R packages.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
checkDocFiles(package, dir, lib.loc = NULL)
checkDocStyle(package, dir, lib.loc = NULL)
checkReplaceFuns(package, dir, lib.loc = NULL)
checkS3methods(package, dir, lib.loc = NULL)

langElts
nonS3methods(package)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>package</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string naming an installed package.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>dir</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string specifying the path to a package's root
source directory.  This should contain the subdirectories &lsquo;<span class="file">R</span>&rsquo;
(for R code) and &lsquo;<span class="file">man</span>&rsquo; with <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> documentation sources (in Rd
format).  Only used if <code>package</code> is not given.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>lib.loc</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector of directory names of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> libraries,
or <code>NULL</code>.  The default value of <code>NULL</code> corresponds to all
libraries currently known.  The specified library trees are used to
search for <code>package</code>.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>checkDocFiles</code> checks, for all Rd files in a package, whether all
arguments shown in the usage sections of the Rd file are documented in
its arguments section.  It also reports duplicated entries in the
arguments section, and &lsquo;over-documented&rsquo; arguments which are
given in the arguments section but not in the usage.  Note that the
match is for the usage section and not a possibly existing synopsis
section, as the usage is what gets displayed.
</p>
<p><code>checkDocStyle</code> investigates how (S3) methods are shown in the
usages of the Rd files in a package.  It reports the methods shown by
their full name rather than using the Rd <code style="white-space: pre;">\method</code> markup for
indicating S3 methods.  Earlier versions of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> also reported about
methods shown along with their generic, which typically caused
problems for the documentation of the primary argument in the generic
and its methods.  With <code style="white-space: pre;">\method</code> now being expanded in a way
that class information is preserved, joint documentation is
no longer necessarily a problem.  (The corresponding information is
still contained in the object returned by <code>checkDocStyle</code>.)
</p>
<p><code>checkReplaceFuns</code> checks whether replacement functions or S3/S4
replacement methods in the package R code have their final argument
named <code>value</code>.
</p>
<p><code>checkS3methods</code> checks whether all S3 methods defined in the
package R code have all arguments of the corresponding generic, with
positional arguments of the generics in the same positions for the
method.  As an exception, the first argument of a formula method
<em>may</em> be called <code>formula</code> even if this is not the name used
by the generic.  The rules when <code>...</code> is involved are subtle:
see the source code.  Functions recognized as S3 generics are those
with a call to <code>UseMethod</code> in their body, internal S3 generics
(see <a href="../../base/html/InternalMethods.html">InternalMethods</a>), and S3 group generics (see
<code><a href="../../base/html/groupGeneric.html">Math</a></code>).  Possible dispatch under a
different name is not taken into account.  The generics are sought
first in the given package, then in the <span class="pkg">base</span> package and
(currently) the packages <span class="pkg">graphics</span>, <span class="pkg">stats</span>, and <span class="pkg">utils</span>
added in R 1.9.0 by splitting the former <span class="pkg">base</span>, and, if an
installed package is tested, also in the loaded namespaces/packages
listed in the package's &lsquo;<span class="file">DESCRIPTION</span>&rsquo; Depends field.
</p>
<p><code>nonS3methods(package)</code> returns a <code><a href="../../base/html/character.html">character</a></code> vector with
the names of the functions in <code>package</code> which &lsquo;look&rsquo; like
S3 methods, but are not.  Using <code>package = NULL</code> returns all
known examples.
</p>
<p><code>langElts</code> is a character vector of names of &ldquo;language
elements&rdquo; of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>.  These are implemented as &ldquo;very primitive&rdquo;
functions (no argument list; <code><a href="../../base/html/print.html">print</a>()</code>ing as
<code>.Primitive("&lt;name&gt;")</code>).
</p>
<p>If using an installed package, the checks needing access to all <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>
objects of the package will load the package (unless it is the
<span class="pkg">base</span> package), after possibly detaching an already loaded
version of the package.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The functions return objects of class the same as the respective
function names containing the information about problems detected.
There are <code>print</code> methods for nicely displaying the information
contained in such objects.
