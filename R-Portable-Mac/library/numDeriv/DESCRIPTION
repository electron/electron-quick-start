Title: Accurate Numerical Derivatives
Description: Methods for calculating (usually) accurate
	numerical first and second order derivatives. Accurate calculations 
	are done using 'Richardson''s' extrapolation or, when applicable, a
	complex step derivative is available. A simple difference 
	method is also provided. Simple difference is (usually) less accurate
	but is much quicker than 'Richardson''s' extrapolation and provides a 
	useful cross-check. 
	Methods are provided for real scalar and vector valued functions.
