utf8 1.1.3
==========

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

  * Make output_utf8() always return TRUE on Windows, so that characters
    in the user's native locale don't get escaped by utf8_encode(). The
    downside of this change is that on Windows, utf8_width() reports the
    wrong values for characters outside the user's locale when stdout()
    is redirected by knitr or another process.

  * When truncating long strings strings via utf8_format(), use an ellipsis
    that is printable in the user's native locale ("\u2026" or "...").


utf8 1.1.2 (2017-12-14)
=======================

BUG FIXES

  * Fix bug in utf8_format() with non-NULL width argument.


utf8 1.1.1 (2017-11-28)
=======================

BUG FIXES

  * Fix PROTECT bug in as_utf8().


utf8 1.1.0 (2017-11-20)
=======================

NEW FEATURES

  * Added output_ansi() and output_utf8() functions to test for
    output capabilities.

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

  * Add utf8 argument to utf8_encode(), utf8_format(), utf8_print(),
    and utf8_width() for precise control over assumed output capabilities;
    defaults to the result of output_utf8().

  * Add ability to style backslash escapes with the escapes arguments
    to utf8_encode() and utf8_print(). Switch from "faint" styling
    to no styling by default.

  * Slightly reword error messages for as_utf8().

  * Fix (spurious) rchk warnings.

BUG FIXES

  * Fix bug in utf8_width() determining width of non-ASCII strings
    when LC_CTYPE=C.

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

  * No longer export the C version of as_utf8() (the R version is still
    present).


utf8 1.0.0 (2017-11-06)
=======================

NEW FEATURES

  * Split off functions as_utf8(), utf8_valid(), utf8_normalize(),
    utf8_encode(), utf8_format(), utf8_print(), and utf8_width()
    from [corpus][corpus] package.

  * Added special handling for Unicode grapheme clusters in formatting
    and width measurement functions.

  * Added ANSI styling to escape sequences.

  * Added ability to style row and column names in utf8_print().
