NAME
       rbox - generate point distributions for qhull

SYNOPSIS
       Command "rbox" (w/o arguments) lists the options.

DESCRIPTION
       rbox  generates random or regular points according to the
       options given, and  outputs  the  points  to  stdout.  The
       points  are  generated in a cube, unless 's' or given. The
       format of the output is the following: first line contains
       the dimension and a comment, second line contains the num-
       ber of points, and the following lines contain the points,
       one  point per line. Points are represented by their coor-
       dinate values.

rbox(1)                                                   rbox(1)


              coordinates +3/-3.

              tice (Mesh) of integer points.

       rbox P0 P0 P0 P0 P0
              5 copies of the origin in 3-d.  Try 'rbox P0 P0  P0
              P0 P0 | qhull QJ'.

              point.

       100 s Z1e-7

OPTIONS
       n      number of points

       Dn     dimension n-d (default 3-d)

       Bn     bounding box coordinates (default 0.5)

       l      spiral distribution, available only in 3-d

       Ln     lens  distribution  of  radius n.  May be used with
              's', 'r', 'G', and 'W'.

       Mn,m,r lattice  (Mesh)  rotated  by  {[n,-m,0],   [m,n,0],
              [0,0,r],  ...}.   Use  'Mm,n'  for a rigid rotation
              with r = sqrt(n^2+m^2).  'M1,0'  is  an  orthogonal
              lattice.   For  example,  '27  M1,0'  is  {0,1,2} x
              {0,1,2} x {0,1,2}.

       s      cospherical points randomly generated in a cube and
              projected to the unit sphere

       x      simplicial  distribution.   It  is fixed for option
              'r'.  May be used with 'W'.

       y      simplicial distribution plus a simplex.   Both  'x'
              and 'y' generate the same points.

       Wn     restrict  points  to distance n of the surface of a
              sphere or a cube

       c      add a unit cube to the output

       c Gm   add a cube with all combinations of +m  and  -m  to
              the output

rbox(1)                                                   rbox(1)


       d      add a unit diamond to the output.

       d Gm   add a diamond made of 0, +m and -m to the output

       Pn,m,r add point [n,m,r] to the output first.  Pad coordi-
              nates with 0.0.

       n      Remove the command line from the first line of out-
              put.

       On     offset the data by adding n to each coordinate.

       t      use  time  in  seconds  as  the  random number seed
              (default is command line).

       tn     set the random number seed to n.

       z      generate integer coordinates.  Use 'Bn'  to  change
              the  range.   The  default  is 'B1e6' for six-digit
              coordinates.  In R^4, seven-digit coordinates  will
              overflow hyperplane normalization.

       Zn s   restrict points to a disk about the z+ axis and the
              sphere (default Z1.0).  Includes the opposite pole.
              'Z1e-6'  generates  degenerate  points under single
              precision.

       Zn Gm s
              same as Zn with an empty center (default G0.5).

       r s D2 generate a regular polygon

       r s Z1 G0.1
              generate a regular cone

BUGS
       Some combinations of arguments generate odd results.
