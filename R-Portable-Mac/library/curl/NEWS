3.2
 - Windows: Update libcurl to 7.59.0
 - Update curl_symbols dataset to 7.59.0
 - Fix an IDN unit test (malmö.se has messed up their SSL cert)
 - Add unit test for multi_fdset
 - Add backport of trimws for R 3.1

3.1
 - Fix potential memory bug in curl() when doubling the buffer is insufficient.
 - Windows: update to libcurl 7.56.1, restore support for libssh2.
 - Added unit test for curl_echo() to post large multipart data.
 - Fix IDN unit test error "string has forbidden bi-directional properties"

3.0
 - MAJOR CHANGE ON WINDOWS: On Windows 7 / 2008-R2 and up we switch from OpenSSL to native Windows SSL
   (secure channel). Therefore curl now uses certificates from the windows certificate manager.
   This enables users on corporate/government networks to connect through enterprise proxies and such.
   On Windows Vista/2008 and older (including CRAN) we still use OpenSSL to guarantee TLS 1.1/1.2 support.
 Other changes:
 - Windows: updated libcurl to v7.56.0 with dual SSL and native IDN/SSPI
 - multi_add() and curl_fetch_multi() gain an optional 'data' callback parameter
 - New function multi_fdset() returns the file descriptors of a multi pool
 - Add CURLOPT_PROXYAUTH = CURLAUTH_ANY to default handle settings

2.8.1
 - Windows: switch back to OpenSSL instead of SecureChannel because Windows 2008 (CRAN) does not
   support TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 which is required for many servers now.

2.8 (unpublished)
 - Windows: EXPERIMENTAL: on R 3.5+ curl now uses SecureChannel instead of OpenSSL for https.
 - Windows: updated libcurl to v7.54.1 with native windows IDN. Dropped nghttp2 and rtmp support.
 - Windows: nslookup() now uses IdnToAscii() for non-ascii domains
 - Add IDN unit tests on supported platforms
 - Error messages from libcurl include more detail when available (via CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER)
 - Set a default CURLOPT_READFUNCTION because libcurls default can cause R to freeze
 - Fix a bug for empty forms and/or empty form-fields (+ added unit tests for this)
 - The 'multi_run()' function gains a parameter 'poll' to return immediately when a request completes.
 - Disable 'Expect: 100-continue' for POST requests (deprecated in libcurl)
 - Fix two rchk PROTECT warnings (thanks to Tomas Kalibera)

2.7
 - New function parse_headers_list() to parse response headers into named list
 - nslookup() gains a parameter 'multi' to return multiple matches
 - Automatically set 'POSTFIELDSIZE_LARGE' when setting 'POSTFIELDS' or 'COPYPOSTFIELDS' to raw vector
 - Do not crash when passing invalid objects as handles
 - Workaround for empty forms, i.e. calling handle_setform() with no arguments

2.6
 - nslookup() gains a parameter ipv4_only = TRUE (fixes unit test on Mavericks)

2.5
 - Add curl_echo() function for easy testing
 - Add support for curlopt_xferinfofunction, used in curl_echo()
 - Automatically set curlopt_noprogress = 0 when setting one of the progress functions

 - Default User-Agent is now: options("HTTPUserAgent")
 - Requests will now abort if progress/xferinfo callback raises an error
 - Open a connection with mode 'f' to skip stop_for_status() during open()

2.4
 - Windows: update libcurl to 7.53.1 with libssl 1.0.2k
 - New form_data() function to POST form with string/raw values with custom conten-type

 - Tweaks for open(con, blocking = FALSE)
 - Switch memcpy() to memmove() to please valgrind
 - Assert that curl() connection is only opened in read mode

2.3

 - Enable interruptable interface by default, even in non-interactive mode.
 - Update libcurl on Windows to 7.51.0

 - Support open(con, blocking = FALSE) and isIncomplete() for curl() connections
 - Switch curl_fetch_stream to non-blocking implementation

 - Fix big endian build on GLIBC systems (tnx Aurelien Jarno and Andreas Tille)

2.1
