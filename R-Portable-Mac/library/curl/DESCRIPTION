Description: The curl() and curl_download() functions provide highly
    configurable drop-in replacements for base url() and download.file() with
    better performance, support for encryption (https, ftps), gzip compression,
    authentication, and other 'libcurl' goodies. The core of the package implements a
    framework for performing fully customized requests where data can be processed
    either in memory, on disk, or streaming via the callback or connection
    interfaces. Some knowledge of 'libcurl' is recommended; for a more-user-friendly
    web client see the 'httr' package which builds on this package with http
    specific tools and logic.
