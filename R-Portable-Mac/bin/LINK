usage="Usage: R CMD LINK [options] linkcmd

Perform the specified linkcmd by passing it through GNU libtool and
setting a few useful R-related options.  Use in particular when creating
executables linked against the R shared library.

Options:
  -h, --help            print short help message and exit
  -v, --version         print version info and exit

Currently only is useful when creating executables, using the C or C++
compiler for linking.  If FORTRAN code is to be linked, it needs to be
manually ensured that the linker flags for the FORTRAN are included.
